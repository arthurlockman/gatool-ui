            <h3>What is gatool?</h3>
            <p>gatool is a tool to provide <i><b>FIRST®</b></i> Game Announcers with up to date information while announcing events
                during the <i><b>FIRST</b></i> Robotics season. As a web-based tool, it uses up-to-date information about the event to
                provide a comprehensive set of useful data to Game Announcers. It is designed to work on desktops,
                laptops and tablet devices. In a pinch, it can be used on a mobile phone.</p>
            <p>gatool is available as a <a href="https://www.gatool.org">web site</a>. You will need a login to
                access the tool. All registered GAs and MCs will receive an invitation with a login and password. </p>
            <p>If you are disinclined to read the documentation contained in this site, we've made a short video so you
                can see it in action. </p>
            <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-n96KgtgYF0">Watch an overview of gatool on YouTube.</a></p>
            <p>You can review the <i><b>FIRST</b></i> MC and GA resources <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/emcee-and-game-announcer-training-material">here.</a></p>

            <h3>How do I make gatool full screen on my iPad?</h3>
            <p>In Safari, you can save gatool to your home screen. In the address bar, tap the <strong>Share</strong>
                button and choose <strong>Add to Home Screen</strong>. </p>
            <p><img src="images/Add-to-home-screen.png" alt="Add to Home Screen on iPad"></p>
            <p>This will add an icon on your iPad's home screen, and gatool will now behave like an app. The icon will
                be whatever you have on the screen at the time you Add to Home Screen, so you might want to have the
                Play by Play or Cheat Sheet screen open when you save. </p>
            <p>In other browsers, use their native Full Screen modes.</p>

        <div id="helpHowDoIUse" class="tab-pane fade helpSection">
            <h2>How do I use gatool?</h2>
            <p>gatool is organized in tabs. Each tab provides focused information to the user to help with specific
                aspects of a competition. The basic flow is:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Select your event</li>
                <li>Load crowd-sourced data from the gatool Cloud</li>
                <li>Adjust team data by interviewing teams in the pits and around the competition</li>
                <li>Upload your new team data to the gatool Cloud (on-site GAs and MCs only, please, to avoid collision)
                </li>
                <li>Qualification Matches</li>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Announce teams</li>
                    <li>Call play-by-play</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Announce Alliance Selection</li>
                <li>Playoff Matches</li>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Announce teams</li>
                    <li>Call play-by-play</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Awards</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The ultimate goal of the gatool is to reduce paper and empower Game Announcers with more relevant and
                more up-to-date match data.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolSetup.png" alt="gatool Setup screen instructions." width="900"></p>
        </div>
        <div id="helpSetup" class="tab-pane fade helpSection">
            <h3>Setup</h3>
            <p>The Setup tab is where you select your event. Choose a year, then the event. On a laptop or desktop, you
                will have a search filter for the events. On tablets and mobile devices, you will need to scroll to find
                your event.</p>
            <p>The screen will display status information about the data that are available for the event. These data are read directly from <i><b>FIRST</b></i>, and they are updated throughout the competition by the Field Management System. As the event progresses, more data will be available and the status indicators will change.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolEventFilter.png" alt="gatool Setup screen search bar." width="500"></p>
            <p>While event data load, you will see a pink progress bar below the event selector. It will disappear when
                team data have loaded. When a match schedule for the event is available, <strong>the Match Schedule tab
                    will turn green</strong>. This is your clue that the match schedule is loaded and you are ready to
                go to work.
                <strong>Ranks</strong> will turn green once rank data becomes available, and <strong>Alliance
                    Selection</strong> will turn green once Qualification matches complete.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolFullyLoaded.png" alt="gatool Setup screen instructions." width="750"></p>
            <p>Once you complete Alliance Selection, return to this page to load the Playoff schedule by tapping or
                clicking <strong>"Tap here to refresh Playoff Schedule, when available."</strong> Playoff schedule
                changes (as a result of match play and advancement criteria during Playoff stages) will load automatically as the
                competition progresses. </p>
            <p>You can change whether and how gatool displays certain information in other screens. Adjust the switches to configure gatool to your specific tastes. You can make adjustments during an event, too. For instance, it is common to disable Sponsors on Announce once all teams have been introduced for the first time.</p>
            <p><img src="images/setupcontrols.png" width="500px"></p>
            <p>At the bottom of the screen, there are six buttons, organized by function: Maintenance functions, Teams information, and Cloud Sync.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reset local storage.</strong> You can update team information locally, and the updates are
                    stored in your browser. These changes are persistent, so you can make changes in one event and they
                    will
                    be there for the next event, so long as you don't reset the local storage. Use this button only as a
                    troubleshooting step in the case that the tool stops working.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Logout of gatool.</strong> When you logout, your local changes will persist, so you can
                    login later and your team data will still be here.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Save Teams Data to gatool Cloud.</strong> gatool allows on-site GAs and MCs to gather
                    current team data, store it in gatool, and then save it to the gatool Cloud. This allows a GA or MC to
                    record data on a laptop, for instance, save it to the gatool Cloud, and then load it on their iPad. Also,
                    the updated team information becomes available to all GAs and MCs as soon as you save it to the gatool
                    Cloud. <strong><em>We ask that only onsite GAs and MCs save to the gatool Cloud.</em></strong></li>
                <li><strong>Load Teams Data from gatool Cloud.</strong> You can load updated team information from
                    the gatool Cloud. Once you select an event, you can retrieve the crowd-sourced team information <em>for that selected event </em>before you cruise the pits and interview the teams. This will save time for you and result in a more consistent experience for everyone.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Save Environment to gatool Cloud.</strong> gatool allows you to save your specific changes to your own record in gatool Cloud. This allows you to set up one device and then load the changes on another device without affecting other gatool users. This is very handy when you are working at offseason events where you would not want to publish global changes to placeholder teams.</li>
                <li><strong>Load Environment from the gatool Cloud.</strong> Use this button to load your saved changes to another device, once you have saved your Environment to gatool Cloud.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><img src="images/gatool-new-buttons.png" alt="Buttons at the bottom of the Setup screen" width="500"></p>
        </div>
        <div id="helpMatchSchedule" class="tab-pane fade helpSection">
            <h3>Match Schedule</h3>
            <p>The Match Schedule tab displays the match schedule data. This is up-to-date data from <i><b>FIRST</b></i>. You can always re-load the schedule from the Setup page. The Match Schedule is read only, and it will exapnd to include Playoff matches once they become available. The Match Schedule also shows match results as they become available. It also shows predicted and actual match times to help you understand how close to on schedule your event is running.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolMatchSchedule.png" alt="gatool Match Schedule Screen." width="750"></p>
            <p>After a match's score has posted, you can get details about that match by tapping on the score.</p>
            <p><img src="/images/matchDetails.png" width="750px"></p>
        </div>
        <div id="helpTeamData" class="tab-pane fade helpSection">
            <h3>Team Data</h3>
            <p>The Team Data tab displays information about the teams that are registered for the event. The table displays the current data from <i><b>FIRST</b></i>, but it allows you to modify what you see in the Announce and Play-by-play screens.</p>
            <p>You can also dowmload a spreadsheet containing the team details and schedule (when available). Tap on the link at the top of the table to download the team data and schedule. You can merge this with Word to create team data sheets you can hand out at an event. <a href="images/gatool_team_information_sheets.docx">Tap here to download the merge document (docx).</a> Note, the merge doc contains conditional merge tags. Do not edit the merged fields, as they will no longer work properly. Feel free to edit any other portion of the document.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolTeamData.png" width="750px" alt="Team Data page"></p>
            <p>Tap on a team number to open its details page. Edit any of the data in the form and tap <strong>Done</strong> to save the changes. These changes will appear in the <strong>Team Data</strong>, so if you want to revert any change to the <i><b>FIRST</b></i> data, simple clear the field in the details page and tap <strong>Done</strong>. If you want to erase ALL changes and revert to the data supplied by <i><b>FIRST</b></i>, reset the local storage from the Setup Screen.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolSortTeamTable.png" width="750px" alt="Team Data Sorting feature"></p>
            <p>When you make changes to a team's data, gatool records that as a "visit" to the team. Last visit times appear nder the team number, and the team number button will turn green if you have recorded a visit to a team. This can be very helpful as you work the pits. You must tap <strong>Done</strong> or <strong>Save Team Data to gatool Cloud</strong> to record a visit. Note that if you exit a Team Details page without recording a visit, no changes will be saved. You can reset all visit times by tapping on the <strong>Reset all visit times</strong> button at the bottom of the table.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolResetVisitTimes.png" width="750px" alt="Team Details visit times reset button">
            </p>
            <p>The Team Table is sortable. Tap on any column head to sort by that column. Once sorted, tapping again
                will reverse the sort order of that column.</p>
            <p>It is a best practice not to adjust the Awards field for a specific team. If you do, new Awards will not accrue to the teams whose Awards you edit. Instead, use the Awards controls on the Setup page. You can clear out all of the changes you have made to Awards, leaving all other changes intact, by tapping on the <strong>Reset stored awards </strong>button at the bottom of the Team Data screen. Note: it is a best practice to reset awards at the start of an event.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolTeamDataUpdate.png" width="750px" alt="Team Data details page"></p>
            <p>Any updated information is stored in the browser's local storage, so it should persist even if you close
                the browser or switch events. You can load crowd sourced team data by tapping on the <strong>Load Event Data from the gatool Cloud</strong> button on the Setup Screen.</p>
            <p>If you are a GA or MC at an event, please confer with your GA or MC partner, update your local team data,
                and then save it to the gatool Cloud. &nbsp;You can save to the gatool Cloud by tapping <strong>Save Event Data to the gatool Cloud</strong> on the Setup Screen. Once you have saved, you can load the data on another device so that all of your devices are synced. <strong><em>We ask that only the on-site GA or MC save to gatool cloud during an event.</em></strong></p>
        </div>
        <div id="helpAnnounce" class="tab-pane fade helpSection">
            <h3>Announce</h3>
            <p>Once you have interviewed the teams and have updated their robot names and sponsors (and other items, of
                course!) in your gatool, you are ready to announce. There are two screens for match announcing:
                <strong>Announce</strong>
                and <strong>Play-by-play.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The <strong>Announce Screen</strong> is organized to make it easy for you and your emcee to announce the
                teams before a match. The screen presents the teams in announce order, so you should be able to read
                from
                top to bottom. The current match is indicated at the top and bottom of the screen. Also, there are
                buttons
                to cycle through the matches. You can use these buttons to preview upcoming matches or to review
                previous
                matches. Each time you tap the <strong>Next Match</strong> or <strong>Previous Match</strong> buttons, a
                call is made to retrieve current ranking data. It is best to retrieve current ranking data right before
                your
                current match to fetch the latest results from <i><b>FIRST</b></i>. </p>
            <p>The Announce screen includes a lot of information about the teams, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Team number</li>
                <li>Rookie year</li>
                <li>Team Name</li>
                <li>Hometown</li>
                <li>Robot name</li>
                <li>Organization or school</li>
                <li>Sponsors</li>
                <li>Awards</li>
                <li>Current event ranking</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ranking is color coded to help build excitement. The number 1 alliance is highlighted in gold. Numbers 2
                through 8 are highlighted in green. Numbers 9 and 10 are highlighted in yellow.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolAnnounce.png" width="750px" alt="Announce screen details"></p>
            <h3>Playoff features</h3>
            <p>During the Playoffs, you might need to substitute or rearrange teams in their stations. To replace a
                team,
                simply <strong>tap on a team number</strong>. Enter the replacement team number and tap <strong>Make it
                    so</strong>. The Announce and Play-by-play screens will now show data for the replacement team. The
                update will not affect other gatool users, nor will it update FMS. FMS will publish the match results
                with
                the substitutions after the match completes.</p>
            <p>You will not be allowed to substitute a team that does not appear in the event. </p>

            <h3>Play-by-play</h3>
            <p>The Play-by-play screen is organized to make it easy for you to provide colorful and relevant commentary
                during a match. The screen presents the teams from the perspective of the scoring table, with Blue
                Alliance on the left and Red Alliance on the right. The current match is indicated at the top of the
                screen. The
                tournament high score to date is indicated at the bottom of the screen. <strong>Note: </strong>The high
                score indicator is also a button that refreshes the current standings. </p>
            <p>At the top and bottom of the screen, there are buttons to cycle through the matches. You can use these
                buttons to preview upcoming matches or to review previous matches. Each time you tap the Next Match or
                Previous Match buttons, a call is made to retrieve current ranking data. It is best to refresh current
                match data right before your current match to ensure that you have the the latest results from FMS. </p>
            <p>The Announce screen includes a reduced set of information about the teams, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Team number</li>
                <li>Team Name</li>
                <li>Hometown</li>
                <li>Robot name</li>
                <li>Organization or school</li>
                <li>Current event ranking</li>
                <li>Qualification average</li>
                <li>Win-loss-tie record</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ranking is color coded to help build excitement and it follows the scheme from the Announce screen.</p>

            <p>At the top center of the screen, there is a match timer. This is a handy tool to help you identify the
                time remaining in the match and what phase of the match is currently active. Tap it once to start the
                timer,
                and tap it at any time to reset the timer. The phases of the timer include:</p>
            <p><strong>Autonomous. </strong>During the Autonomous period, the timer is orange and counts down to the end
                of Autonomous period.</p>
            <p><strong>Teleoperated. </strong>During the Teleoperated period, the timer is green and counts down to the
                Endgame, which begins when 30 seconds remain in the match.</p>
            <p><strong>Endgame. </strong>During the Endgame, the timer is red. When 10 seconds remain in the match, it
                will
                cycle alternatingly red and white until time expires.</p>

            <h3>Playoff features</h3>
            <p>During the Playoffs, you might need to substitute or rearrange teams in their stations. To replace a
                team,
                simply <strong>tap on a team number</strong>. Enter the replacement team number and tap <strong>Make it
                    so</strong>. The Announce and Play-by-play screens will now show data for the replacement team. The
                update will not affect other gatool users, nor will it update FMS. FMS will publish the match results
                with
                the substitutions after the match completes.</p>
            <p>You will not be allowed to substitute a team that does not appear in the event. </p>

            <h3>Alliance Selection</h3>
            <p>The Alliance Selection Screen is designed to help you and your emcee inform and entertain during Alliance
                Selection. Often the most confusing part of any <i><b>FIRST</b></i> event, Alliance Selection is a critical component
                of
                the <i><b>FIRST</b></i> competition philosophy. In many venues, there is no clear view of the scoring screen, which
                can
                impede teams when making their Alliance partner choices. Also, it is difficult for a Game Announcer to
                search through a long list
                of teams in order to call out their names, schools and home towns after their number is called by the
                Alliance Captain.</p>
            <p>The Alliance Selection Screen uses a "tap on the team" interface to help ease the stress of Alliance
                Selection, and it is intended to be used by both emcees and Game Announcers. To ensure that you have the
                latest ranking data, tap on the high score on the Play-by-play Screen or by cycle backward and forward
                on
                the Announce or Play-by-play Screens. </p>
            <p>There is a status indicator that lets you know whether gatool believes it has the final rankings in order
                to proceed with Alliance Selection. Please be sure to review the rankings with your Scorekeeper before
                proceeding with Alliance Selection.</p>
            <p>All team numbers on the screen are active, so that when you tap them, you will have options based on
                whether
                the team is available for selection. As teams accept their invitations, the screen will adjust to
                reflect
                the decisions. If you make a mistake, you can always undo the choice.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolAlliance0.png" width="750px" alt="Alliance Selection"></p>
            <p>Alliance Captains are organized according to the ranking at the completion of Qualification play, and the
                Alliance Captains are pre-populated in their Alliances. The Alliances are on the right hand side of the
                screen. The current Alliance pick is also highlighted with a red border. Before Alliance Selection
                begins,
                it is customary to introduce the Alliance Captains. Tap on their team number to reveal their team
                particulars, then choose <strong>Alliance Captain Announce</strong> to dismiss the dialog.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolAlliance1.png" width="750px" alt="Alliance Selection"></p>
            <p>To make a selection, tap on a team number. A modal dialog will appear that displays the team number,
                name,
                hometown and organization. This is to help the Game Announcer provide details about the team as they
                come
                onto the field to accept of decline the offer to join the Alliance. If the accept the offer, tap
                <strong>Gratefully
                    Accept</strong>. If they decline the offer, tap <strong>Respectfully Decline</strong>.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolAlliance2.png" width="750px" alt="Alliance Selection"></p>
            <p>When a team accepts an offer, the folowing actions occur: they will be committed to the highlighted
                Alliance
                position, the team will be removed from the list of available teams, and the highlighted Alliance choice
                will advance to the next choice. If the invited team is in the top 8 of the remaining teams, they will
                move
                out of the green and pink boxes and move to the Alliance box. If they decline the offer, then select
                another
                team. If you make a mistake, you can undo the choice, all the way back to the beginning.</p>
            <p>Alliance Captains who have not yet chosen their first Alliance partner are also eligible for Alliance
                selection. If you tap an Alliance Captain, announce their particulars and choose <strong>Gratefully
                    Accept</strong> or <strong>Respectfully Decline</strong>. If they accept, their team will move to
                the
                highlighted Alliance choice, and all of the Captains below their rank will advance one slot. In
                addition, a
                new number 8 Captain will come out of the available alliance pool according to the qualification
                rankings. A
                new team will flow into the bottom of the green box, according to the qualification rankings.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolAlliance3.png" width="750px" alt="Alliance Selection"></p>
            <p>There is a special Championship case, in which Alliances contain 4 teams and there are no reserves.
                gatool
                understands this situation and will display a third choice for each Alliance. Since there are no backups
                in
                this situation, there is no Backup Alliance box in Championship Alliance Selection.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolAlliance4.png" width="750px" alt="Alliance Selection" </p> <p>We have designed the
                Alliance Selection screen with simplicity and utility in mind. We hope that Emcees, Game
                Announcers and event coordinators will find it useful.</p>
